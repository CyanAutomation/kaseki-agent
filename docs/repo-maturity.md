## Log contract (JSONL stage events)

Operational scripts emit one JSON object per line using this schema:

- `timestamp`: UTC ISO-8601 time (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`)
- `component`: script or subsystem emitting the event (for example `run-kaseki`, `kaseki-agent`)
- `stage`: lifecycle step name (for example `clone`, `validation`, `deploy`, `cleanup`)
- `status`: event state (`started`, `finished`, `error`, or `info`)
- `instance`: instance identifier or logical scope (`kaseki-42`, `template`, `maintenance`)
- `detail`: sanitized human-readable detail (must not include secrets, tokens, keys, or auth env values)

Example events:

```json
{"timestamp":"2026-04-29T12:00:00Z","component":"run-kaseki","stage":"clone","status":"started","instance":"kaseki-42","detail":"cloning repository"}
{"timestamp":"2026-04-29T12:00:04Z","component":"run-kaseki","stage":"clone","status":"finished","instance":"kaseki-42","detail":"repository cloned successfully"}
{"timestamp":"2026-04-29T12:00:10Z","component":"kaseki-agent","stage":"validation","status":"error","instance":"kaseki-42","detail":"validation command failed with exit code 1"}
```

🧭 Maturity Scoring Rubric (v2 — Deterministic)

Overview

This rubric measures how close a repository is to being a reliable, runnable, and maintainable product.

It is:

* deterministic
* repeatable
* automation-friendly

It does not measure:

* popularity
* code cleverness
* project size

⸻

Core Principle

Your maturity score answers:

“How close is this repo to being a reliable, runnable, maintainable product?”

⸻

Scoring System Structure

Final Score = Base Score (0–100) + Modifiers (±10 max) – Penalties (0–20 max)

* Base Score → universal, signal-based (0–100)
* Modifiers → repo-type adjustments (±10 max)
* Penalties → deterministic deductions (capped at -20)

⸻

🧱 Base Rubric (Signal-Based)

Each category:

* contains 5 binary signals (0 or 1)
* total signals → category score (0–5)
* weighted into final base score

Category Score Formula

category_score = number_of_signals_met (0–5)
category_contribution = (category_score / 5) × weight

## Runner result status contract

The host and container runners publish a small deterministic status contract in each run result directory:

- `exit_code`: Final workflow exit code produced by the in-container runner (`kaseki-agent.sh`).
- `host_docker_exit_code`: Exit code returned by the host `docker run` process.
- `host_exit_code`: Host-side status persisted by `run-kaseki.sh` for all host exits (including pre-container failures).
- `stage-timings.tsv`: Tab-separated per-stage entries in the format `stage\texit_code\tduration_seconds\tdetail`.
- `validation-timings.tsv`: Tab-separated validation command timing entries in the format `command\texit_code\tduration_seconds`.

These files are intended to be machine-consumed and should remain stable across refactors.
